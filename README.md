## Context

Portugal's economic growth is significantly tied to tourism. The Recovery and Resilience Plan (PRR) initiated the ATT agenda (Accelerate and Transform Tourism) to implement disruptive and innovative solutions across selected focal points throughout the tourist experience. Trailblazer is a key component of this agenda.

## Problem

Existing tourism support systems face a critical issue: service fragmentation across multiple platforms, complicating data analysis and management. Low-Density Population Areas face challenges in managing their tourism destinations due to infrastructure limitations, sparse populations, and incompatibility with mass tourism models.

## Solution

Trailblazer integrates various services into a centralized hub, simplifying and streamlining management. The platform consolidates information for deeper data analysis, allowing stakeholders to gain insights into tourist behaviors, preferences, and predict future trends. This enhances decision-making and strategy formulation for the tourism sector.
